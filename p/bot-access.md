# Setting up Bot Access

Before going any further, you'll need to ensure you have the `Administrator` permission within the server you're using. If you're the Owner of the server, then you'll have no need to worry about this!

### Granting a role access to certain Admin commands!

The first thing you're going to have to do is ensure that Role Manager has the permissions required for its general purpose. If that's the case, then its time to get our hands dirty..

In any channel, type `/bot-access grant`, this will bring up something looking a little like the image shown below:

Once here, press enter to start forming the command. Before we go any further, you'll need to decide what role you'd like to grant access to and which role you'd like this role to have access to.&#x20;

For the sake of this tutorial, I'll be using the role "Bot Admin" and granting it access to setup Self Roles. Once you've got the role and command you'd like to use, insert them into their designated fields.

Once you've done so, it'll look like the image shown above. From here, simply press enter and you'll be greeted with a confirmation message that looks something like the following:

So there you have it! That's how you setup bot access on Role Manager v3! Should you have any further questions or problems, don't hesistate to join our support server over @ [UtiliBots](https://discord.gg/cAtc7kZbPX)!
