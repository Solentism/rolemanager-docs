# Setting up Role Persists

Before going any further, you'll need to ensure you have the `Administrator` permission within the server you're using. If you're the Owner of the server, then you'll have no need to worry about this!

### Creating a Role Persist on your server with Role Manager!

The first thing you're going to have to do is ensure that Role Manager has the permissions required for its general purpose. If that's the case, then its time to get our hands dirty..

In any channel, type `/role-persist add`, this will bring up something looking a little like the image shown below:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

Once you can see this, press enter on your keyboard. You'll then see two required fields, one is a user field and the other a role field.&#x20;

Once your user has been selected, you'll see something like the following:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Now it's time to select the role, once you've selected the role, you'll see something like the following:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

From here, simply press enter on your keyboard and you're done! On the user specified's arrival, they'll automatically be assigned the role in which you've just selected!

So there you have it! That's how you setup auto-roles on Role Manager v3! Should you have any further questions or problems, don't hesistate to join our support server over @ [UtiliBots](https://discord.gg/cAtc7kZbPX)!
