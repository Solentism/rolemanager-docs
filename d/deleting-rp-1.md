# Deleting a Role's Bot Access

Before going any further, you'll need to ensure you have the `Administrator` permission within the server you're using. If you're the Owner of the server, then you'll have no need to worry about this!&#x20;

### Deleting a Role's Bot Access with Role Manager!

The first thing you're going to have to do is ensure that Role Manager has the permissions required for its general purpose. If that's the case, then its time to get our hands dirty..

In any channel, type `/bot-access revoke`, this will bring up something looking a little like the image shown below:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

This is the command we'll be using to remove a role's access from a role. To do this, simply press enter on that command. From here you'll see two required fields, one being role and the other being command.

From here, select the role in which you want to remove access to perform a command from. Once you've done so, it should look a little something like the following:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

From here, simply select the command the role currently has access to. This is to ensure you're removing the role's access from the command you want and not all admin commands as a whole.

From here, this should then look a little something like the following:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

From here, just simply press enter and boom! Your role's bot access has been removed!

So there you have it! That's how you remove a role's bot access on Role Manager v3! Should you have any further questions or problems, don't hesistate to join our support server over @ [UtiliBots](https://discord.gg/cAtc7kZbPX)!
