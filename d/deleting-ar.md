# Deleting Auto Roles

Before going any further, you'll need to ensure you have the `Administrator` permission within the server you're using. If you're the Owner of the server, then you'll have no need to worry about this!

### Deleting an Auto Role with Role Manager!

The first thing you're going to have to do is ensure that Role Manager has the permissions required for its general purpose. If that's the case, then its time to get our hands dirty..

In any channel, type `/auto-role remove`, this will bring up something looking a little like the image shown below:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

This is the command we'll be using to remove our auto-roles from the server. Deleting auto-roles is super easy! All we have to do is click enter on that command, that will then bring us to a screen that looks like the following:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

From here, simply mention the role in which you'd like to remove and in which you'd like Role Manager to stop assigning to users upon their arrival in your server.

In my case, I'm going to use the same role I used when creating the auto-role in the [Getting Started: Setting up Auto Roles with Role Manager](../p/auto-roles.md) guide.

From here, this should then look a little something like the following:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)

From here, just simply press enter and boom! Your auto-role has been removed!

So there you have it! That's how you remove an auto-role on Role Manager v3! Should you have any further questions or problems, don't hesistate to join our support server over @ [UtiliBots](https://discord.gg/cAtc7kZbPX)!
