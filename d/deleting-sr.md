# Deleting Self Roles

Before going any further, you'll need to ensure you have the `Administrator` permission within the server you're using. If you're the Owner of the server, then you'll have no need to worry about this!

### Deleting a Role on a Self Role menu with Role Manager!

The first thing you're going to have to do is ensure that Role Manager has the permissions required for its general purpose. If that's the case, then its time to get our hands dirty..

In any channel, type `/self-role remove`, this will bring up something looking a little like the image shown below:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>)

This is the command we're going to be using in order to remove a self-role making it impossible for members to get this role from the menu. From here, press enter and we'll be greeted with 2 required fields. One is the Menu ID and the other is the role in which we're going to be removing.

To do this, you'll need your Menu's unique 8 character ID, this is located at the bottom of the embed within your designated self role channel.&#x20;

From here, once you have your ID, place it into the ID field in the command in which we're currently forming. After this, mention the role in the command, this is the one in which we are going to be removing from the embed. Your command should end up looking a little something like the following:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png>)

From here, just simply press enter and boom! Your role has been removed from the self role menu!

So there you have it! That's how you remove roles from a self-role menu on Role Manager v3! Should you have any further questions or problems, don't hesistate to join our support server over @ [UtiliBots](https://discord.gg/cAtc7kZbPX)!
